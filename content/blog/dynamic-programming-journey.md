# Dynamic Programming Journey

Six months ago, I couldn't solve a single DP problem. Today, I solved a Div2 D DP problem in contest. Here's my journey.

## The Struggle Phase (Months 1-2)

I started with classic problems:
- Fibonacci
- Coin Change
- Longest Common Subsequence

Everything felt like magic. I could understand the solutions but couldn't come up with them myself.

## The Breakthrough (Month 3)

I realized I was missing **state definition**. Once I learned to clearly define:
- What does `dp[i]` represent?
- What are my base cases?
- What's my transition?

Things started clicking.

## Practice Strategy

```
Week 1-2: Easy problems (10-15 per week)
Week 3-4: Medium problems (5-7 per week)
Week 5+: Contest problems (3-5 per week)
```

## Key Resources

1. **CSES Problem Set**: Best for building fundamentals
2. **AtCoder DP Contest**: All DP problems, excellent for practice
3. **Codeforces Ladder**: Sorted by difficulty

## Current Stats

- Problems Solved: 250+
- Rating: 1500 → 1750
- Success Rate: 65%

The key is **consistent practice** and **pattern recognition**.
